# First-Summative-Assignment

> First summative assignment for the SOCS0100 module.
>
> R script which processes and visualise data from the [share of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv) dataset (World Bank, 2021)

[Specifically, this R script does the following:]{style="background:#fdbfff"}
