# First-Summative-Assignment

## What this project does

> First summative assignment for the SOCS0100 module.
>
> R script which processes and visualise data from the [share of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv) dataset (World Bank, 2021)

This R script does the following:

1.  Performs three data-wrangling task to produce a refined dataset

2.  Produces reproducible data visualisation based on the refined dataset

## How users can get started with the project

> You need to download the [share of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021)/Number%20of%20people%20with%20and%20without%20energy%20access%20(OWID%20based%20on%20World%20Bank%2C%202021).csv) dataset and importing it into your directory in order to run the r-script

To install it, simply

1.  Download the dataset from the link, then drag it into the `DVHZ3-SOCS0100-Assignment` folder
2.  run the `energy_and_fuel <- read_csv("Number of people with and without energy access (OWID based on World Bank, 2021).csv")` line in order to import the csv file into the dataset under the shorthand name `energy_and_fuel`

## Where users can get help with your project

## Who maintains and contributes to the project

I, an anonymous student, composed this r-script with knowledge learned in SOCS0100. I critically engaged with ChatGPT during the process of code refining and editing.
